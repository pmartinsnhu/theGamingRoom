The Gaming Room is a small game design company that recently found success with their Android-based game – “Draw it or Lose it”. They have approached our firm to expand their market to those on other operating platforms through a client-server distributed environment. I believe I did well in drawing out the constraints necessary to meet the clients needs. Creating a UML diagram was helpful to me when envisioning how the software would be constructed. If I could revise one part of the software design document, I believe it would be the recommendations – mine were not specific enough to help the company. The software cannot be successful unless it meets the needs of the client – it was important for me to not only think about software needs but also the needs of the business. Again, the UML diagram was immensely important to my understanding of the software and the relationships between classes. I would certainly employ this in planning future software projects.
